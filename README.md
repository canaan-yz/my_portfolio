Introduce:  
My portfolio, it's a hard work for backend coder.

## Tech
- Vue3
- Vite
- TailwindCSS
- GitHub Actions

Personal Opinion:  
Vue3, `<script setup>` syntax used in this project, similar to React hooks.
This new feature claims you don't need to consider what `this` indicate to.
But I consider there are some disadvantages verses 'class' syntax:   
- Free writing style is not uniform among different people.  
- Cost of studying, you need to study or search in docs if you want to use `ref` `computed` which need new import sentence.
Frontend ecology changes rapidly, syntax even changes from Vue 3.0 to 3.2 .
